# DEBUG of program

In this chapter, we learn to use the Run panel to debug our code and implement the program's pause, single-step execution, and stop functions.



Edit a program that controls the color change of the LED light at the end of the robotic arm.

Click the `Run` button. When the run panel pops up, click the `Pause button` immediately. The program will pause after executing the first instruction `time.sleep(5)`

The program has been paused. The next instruction to be executed `mc.set_color(255,0,0)` has appeared

- at this time:

  - If you click the `Recover` button, the program will automatically proceed;

  - If you click the `One-step` button, the program will execute the next instruction, which is `mc.set_color(255,0,0)`;
  - If you click the `Stop` button, the program will be terminated;





As for what to do next, it’s up to you!
