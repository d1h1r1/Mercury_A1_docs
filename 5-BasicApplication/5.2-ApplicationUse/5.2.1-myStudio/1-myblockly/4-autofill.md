This chapter learns the function of quickly filling in complex building block data.

When a building block has too many data items to fill in, it would be too cumbersome to fill them in one by one. So for the data item building blocks with too many building blocks, we added a quick fill function.

Currently, the building blocks that support quick filling are as follows:

### How to use quick fill

Taking the setting of the Full Angle building block as an example, you first need to select the Full Angle building block, then click the `Quick Fill' button in the building block, and observe the data changes of the building block.
