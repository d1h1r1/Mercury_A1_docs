# Q&A

This chapter lists common questions about using myBlockly to control robotic arms for reference.



**Question 1: The robot arm is unresponsive because the `sleep` method module is not added**

A: The program of operating the robotic arm takes time to complete, so after an action, a 'sleep' module needs to be connected to allow the robotic arm time to move before proceeding to the next action (the time required depends on the situation), the machine The default setting of the arm is to run myBlockly, and the minimum sleep time is no less than 0.5s, otherwise the robot arm will not be able to achieve ideal movement.
