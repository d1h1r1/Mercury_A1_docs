# Robot arm usage scenario case

This chapter presents classic robotic arm use cases to demonstrate the application of the product in representative scenarios. This includes typical applications of robotic arms in different fields, highlighting the product's versatility and applicability. Through these cases, users can gain an in-depth understanding of the flexibility and performance of the robotic arm in practical applications, providing a reference for their application in specific scenarios.

## Educational Example

In this example, the Mercury A1 robotic arm executes a vision recognition task using its 3D camera, a common application in robotics technology education. Utilizing the 3D camera, the arm accurately identifies wooden blocks and their attached QR codes in the scene. Once identified, the arm moves precisely to the location of the wooden block following programmed instructions and uses the suction pump for grasping. This application not only demonstrates the arm's capabilities in vision processing and object manipulation but also highlights its practicality in the field of education, especially in machine vision and automation learning. Students and researchers can learn how to integrate hardware (such as 3D cameras and robotic arms) with software (like image processing algorithms and control logic) to solve real-world problems through such examples.
