# Learn to use One-step

The so-called `One-step` execution refers to: execution of a single building block. When there are a lot of building blocks in the workspace, I only want to execute one of them to see what the effect is. At this time, you can use single-step execution

> The **One-step** button is disabled by default and is not clickable.



**Step 1:** Drag a few building blocks into the workspace

**Part 2:**Select the Set Color building block and observe that the **Single Step** button has been unlocked (the color has changed to dark)
