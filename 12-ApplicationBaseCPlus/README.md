## What is C++?

C++ is the inheritance of C language, it can not only carry out procedural programming of C language, but also carry out object-based programming characterized by abstract data types, but also carry out object-oriented programming characterized by inheritance and polymorphism. <br>
While C++ is good at object-oriented programming, it can also do process-based programming, so the size of C++ in terms of the size of the problem it ADAPTS to depends on it. <br>
C++ not only has the practical characteristics of efficient operation of computers, but also aims to improve the programming quality of large-scale programs and the problem description ability of programming language.
