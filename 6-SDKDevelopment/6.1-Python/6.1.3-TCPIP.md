# TCP/IP control

Mercury A1 supports socket remote control. We provide a developed python socket server script that can use python to achieve remote control of the robot.

## Server

There are two ways to start the server:

### Method 1

The server script is the Server_A1.py file saved on the system desktop. Run this file to open the socket server.

```shell
python Server_A1.py
```


### Method 2

Open `myStudio`, enter the `Network Server` plug-in, and start the server.

## Client

The client and server are required to be on the same network segment. After the system is powered on, [Self Hotspot](../../5-BasicApplication/5.1-SystemUsageInstructions/5.1-SystemUsageInstructions.md#513-vnc) will be enabled by default. The client computer can connect to the local hotspot or connect to Use it under the same WIFI as the machine.

`pymycobot` contains the socket client API. Client activation usage:

```python
from pymycobot import MercurySocket

mc = MercurySocket("10.42.0.1", 9000)

print(mc.get_angles())
```

The usage of socket API is basically the same as that of serial communication API, and the interface is universal.
